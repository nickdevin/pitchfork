    "With nearly a quarter of a million readers per day, the music review publication Pitchfork is a hugely influential force in the independent music scene. A positive album review from Pitchfork can help launch an artist into more mainstream success, notable examples of which include Arcade Fire and Sufjan Stevens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitchfork has also been the subject of criticism in regards to certain perceived biases in their content. A review of hip-hop artist M.I.A.'s 2007 album *Kala* erroneously stated that Diplo had produced all of the album's tracks, when, in reality, M.I.A. had produced most of the tracks herself. In an interview with Pitchfork, M.I.A. later said, \"There is an issue especially with what male journalists write about me and say 'this *must* have come from a guy.'\" Their early reviews often focused disproportionately on independent rock, though they appear in recent years to have featured a more balanced mixture of genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal in this project is to examine bias in the bias in the reviews, specifically looking to answer the following questions:\n",
    "- How has the proportion of reviews per genre evolved over time?\n",
    "- Is there evidence of bias in scoring based on the genre of an album?\n",
    "- Is there evidence of gender bias in Pitchfork's review? Specifically:\n",
    "    - How has the ratio of reviews of female artists to male artists evolved over time?\n",
    "    - Is there evidence of bias in scoring based on the artist's gender or on the reviewer's gender?\n"
